Baldr - Structure From Motion

Pipeline loosely based off of the following paper:

The Structure-from-Motion Reconstruction Pipeline - A Survey wtih Focus on Short Image Sequences

Klaus Haming and Gabriele Peters


This needs to be much more elaborate at some point


The basic pipeline for this project is as follows:

Video -> Image -> Feature Extraction -> Feature Matching -> Filtering -> Metric Reconstruction




Progress of components:

Video -> Image Sequence: Not Done

Image Sequence -> Features: Not Done

Feature Matching: Not Done

Feature Filtering: Not Done

Reconstruction: Not Done




Future Improvements:
